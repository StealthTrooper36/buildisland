                <p>It‚Äôs a cold night (just kidding you fucking moron its burning as always) in Indonesia, AlmostAGoner (or hellriu i dont fucking know lmao) challenged Zachary (or GILGAROS) to a game of Minecraft Bedwars 4v4 on Hypixel.</p>
                <p>AlmostAGoner had Blaulotz, Eoin and kidneys on his team. Gilgaros had kowlonski, jaxsonpuppupcrazy and a random alt account because gil was very sure he was going to win. You all probably know what happened next, gil‚Äôs team got absolutely decimated.</p>
                <p>2 of their players allegedly walked off the map 50 times and tried to destroy their own bed, the game ended within 2 minutes and Gilgaros was so angry he allegedly shit his pants and swatted Goner.</p>
                <p>Goner had a heart attack causing him to be hospitalized for a week, then GILGAROS broke into the hospital and stabbed AlmostAGoner 59 times, then he reportedly ripped his arm, fried it and ate it.</p>
                <p>Mugshot of 78 year old Zachary ‚ÄúGilgaros‚Äù Bullethead</p>

                <p><em>Look at that disgusting smug on his face.</em></p>
                <p>After the murder, Zachary hid the lifeless corpse (wtf do you expect from a corpse?? ofc it was lifeless) in a McDonald‚Äôs play area, parents were horrified to find the corpse of a bleeding corpse and police were called, they immediately traced it back to Gilgaros and arrested him.</p>
                <p>After his arrest, a moron named Jaxsonpuppupcrazy attempted to break Zachary out of prison but got arrested and Zachary somehow managed to escape himself and fled to Columbia where he was finally murdered by Columbian terrorists that TAF totally didn't fund.</p>
