                <p>On Thursday, the 24th of October, Mythra <i>(formerly known as Koshkavia)</i> invaded and occupied the region of LovebirbLand, which it borders.</p>
                <p>On Friday, the 25th of October, the Tactical Assault Forces (or TAF) started a coalition called <abbr title="Specialize Mercenary Forces">SMF</abbr> that contains countries such as <abbr title="United Robloxian States Army">URSA</abbr> and RASF.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    I couldn't withstand the amount of small nations getting destroyed by Mythra, so I decided to start a Emergency PMC called SMF, Specialised Mercenary Force. We worked together with the Nation of Lovebirb, with a outstanding 15 rally from us and 3 from lovebirb.

                </blockquote>
                <p>Many have been skeptical about the constant invasion of random nations across the Eastern continent. These fears risen afer GILGAROS, the "supreme dictator" of the United States of Mythra had chosen to refer to the Eastern Continent as "Mythra", since they literally own the Build Island larp map, they have the power to do whatever they please.</p>
                <p>After SMF forces invaded and liberated Lovebirbland, the Mythrans were a no show. According to BI larp rules, if a nation isn't present in a battle game, they automatically lose.</p>
                <p>SMF's conditions will likely be to take back Sabota (or PDE), take back Aetheria and the independence of LovebirbLand.</p>
