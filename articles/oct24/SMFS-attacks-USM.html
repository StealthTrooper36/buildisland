                <p>This morning, 109aazo formed a new group named the Specialised Mercenary Forces.</p>
 
               <p>This group is a temporary group, that is being planned to last until December 31th.</p>
 
                <p>This group is most similar to a coalition, though only with the goal of Liberating Lovebirbland.</p>
 
                <p>The group has quickly gotten a good player count, and will exclusively fight in Build Island.</p>
 
                <p>A first battle is planned to happen in a few hours, at 19:19 GMT +1 In Build Island.</p>
 
                <p>We will update you with more information once we know any more.</p>
