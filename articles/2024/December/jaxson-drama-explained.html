                <p>Jax owns a group called “The Dynasty of Peskegua” and he had access to the Mythran espionage channel. GILGAROS <sub>(the guy who nutted to his own roblox avatar)</sub> posted an invite to the RSSU server. Jaxson joined the RSSU server and he got along with them. He decided to ally with RSSU and Gil was outraged.</p>

                <p>They immediately unallied right after. <br>
                    Then Jax made a really poorly written document on Kronstadt Times and kept advertising Build Island Times thinking CometDummy would be pleased.

                <p>CometDummy was angered that Jaxson kept on glazing him causing people to despise Comet due to Jax being unanimously hated across the entire community.</p>

                <p>Skip to a couple of days later and CometDummy vents in BIT.</p>

                <p>Jaxsonpuppupcrazy217 likely saw this and decided to join the BIT server and to his dismay, Comet wasn't pleased with his advertisement. <br>
                    While others were trying to make Comet feel better, Jaxson decided to start whining.

                <p>Jaxson used sad emojis on their messages mockingly and called Comet an attention seeker. Everyone I’ve shown this to reacted with “what the fuck”, and so did I.</p>

                <p>Peskegua was removed from Build Island United.</p>

                    jax is an unlikeable loser who cant accept that he is wrong and will instead block you if you bring up slight criticism about him proceed to spread misinformation about you (as proven by the bs he spread about comet) and also attack your friends lmao! he will also block you and then claim he has changed 2 months later and beg for forgiveness, if you don't forgive him apparently according to jax you are now in the wrong
