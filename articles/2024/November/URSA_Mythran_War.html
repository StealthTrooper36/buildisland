                <p>Yesterday, URSA declared war on USM under the order of the SMF, the reason is to reclaim parts of Hardastan which was stolen by the Mythrans during the first Koshkavian-URSAN war.</p>
                <p>URSA was backed up by the SMF coalition.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <h2>Dear everyone whom it may concern,</h2>
                Today we started on the third stage of our Hadarstan plan, where we retake and liberate parts of Hadarstan that have been taken from us in the Mythran War. These parts of our interest are quite small on the grand scale, though we still have to deal with fierce opposition.
                <br>
                <br>
                 We are leading this last part on direct orders of the SMF, As it is the goal of the coalition to liberate as much of Mythra as possible.
                Together we will make this possible and kill this imperalist, and re-establish the full URSAN nation.
                <br>
                Glory to URSA | المجد لحضرستان

                Both sides have been rallying up their armies to prepare for the war, which will take place today.
                <blockquote>
                <h1>Till the very end</h1>
                Ladies and gentlemen, a threat looms once again on our eastern horizon: <strong>The URSAN STATE.</strong> They have always lurked in the dark, waiting to strike at the height of our greatness, Opposing us from the very start. From the unification wars to the conquest of the Mythran Continent, war has been our constant fuel. It drives us, it feeds us; it shapes our homes, our crops, our childhoods. War is our livelihood. War is our culture.
                <br>
                Our past, our memories, our future, all rely on this unyielding fire. And it will not burn out until we have gone with a fight! It doesn't matter whenever you are a man, a woman, a senior, nor a student, take up arms! Stand for the heartland of our great nation. For our people are the strength behind our shields, the power behind our blades, and our country depends on YOU to make the choice, for it will be the one echoing for generations, Till the Very End.
                <br>

                <h1>Update: MYTHRA HAS AUTOMATICALLY LOST THE WAR</h1>
                <p>Due to their absence, they have automatically lost the war. They were given a generous extra 20 minutes.</p>
                <p>This is obviously very embarassing to the Mythran government as they hyped up their entire army just to lose immediately. Here is a statement from the URSAN government after the swift victory.</p>
                <blockquote>
                 <h1>URSAN Victory and completion of Hardarstan operation</h1>

                <p>Due to the Mythrans voiding the war and not being on-time after we waited 20 mins + Admitting it in DMs of 109 we have officialy won and have taken over the last parts of Hadarstan.

                <p>This means that our nation is finally at the same size of before the Mythran War.

                <h2>For citizens</h2>

                <p>Citiziens of these terriotires will expierince a switchover from Mythran services to URSAN.</p>
