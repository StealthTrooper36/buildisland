                <p>Yesterday, URSA declared war on USM under the order of the SMF, the reason is to reclaim parts of Hardastan which was stolen by the Mythrans during the first Koshkavian-URSAN war.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <h2>Dear everyone whom it may concern,</h2>
                Today we started on the third stage of our Hadarstan plan, where we retake and liberate parts of Hadarstan that have been taken from us in the Mythran War. These parts of our interest are quite small on the grand scale, though we still have to deal with fierce opposition.
                <br>
                <br>
                 We are leading this last part on direct orders of the SMF, As it is the goal of the coalition to liberate as much of Mythra as pssible.
                Together we will make this possible and kill this imperalist, and re-establish the full URSAN nation.
                <br>
                Glory to URSA | المجد لحضرستان
                <div class="blockquote-footer">- Official URSAN statement</div>
                </blockquote>
                Both sides have been rallying up their armies to prepare for the war, which will take place today.
                <blockquote>
                <h1>Till the very end</h1>
                Ladies and gentlemen, a threat looms once again on our eastern horizon: <strong>The URSAN STATE.</strong> They have always lurked in the dark, waiting to strike at the height of our greatness, Opposing us from the very start. From the unification wars to the conquest of the Mythran Continent, war has been our constant fuel. It drives us, it feeds us; it shapes our homes, our crops, our childhoods. War is our livelihood. War is our culture.
                <br>
                Our past, our memories, our future, all rely on this unyielding fire. And it will not burn out until we have gone with a fight! It doesn't matter whenever you are a man, a woman, a senior, nor a student, take up arms! Stand for the heartland of our great nation. For our people are the strength behind our shields, the power behind our blades, and our country depends on YOU to make the choice, for it will be the one echoing for generations, Till the Very End.
                <br>

                <h1>Update: MYTHRA HAS AUTOMATICALLY LOST THE WAR</h1>
                <p>Due to their absence, they are automatically lost the war. They were given a generous extra 20 minutes.</p>
